# Teaser

A teaser is a short text that is used to introduce a topic or content. It is used to give readers a brief overview of what they can expect. Teasers are usually concise and appealing to grab the reader's attention and encourage them to read on.

Depending on the item they describe, these can be structured differently and also contain different information. As a rule, however, they contain the following elements:

- Kicker
- Title
- Description
- Image / Symbol image

Kickers can be inherited via the navigation hierarchy of the article, set individually by the editor or defined via the article type.

Symbol image can be inherited via the navigation hierarchy of the article, set individually by editors or defined via the article type.
