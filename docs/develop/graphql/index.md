# GraphQL API

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a data query and manipulation language developed by Facebook. It allows applications to request precisely the data they need, avoiding over-fetching of information. GraphQL offers a flexible and efficient way to access APIs, granting clients control over data retrieval and enabling the bundling of multiple queries into a single request. This makes GraphQL particularly appealing for modern web applications and mobile apps.

## Work with GraphQL

If you are new to the GraphQL API, see [Getting Started with the GraphQL API](getting-started.md).

You can view the available resources in the GraphQL API reference. The reference is automatically generated from the GitLab GraphQL schema and written to a Markdown file.

The GraphQL API endpoint is located at `/api/graphql`.

The [GraphQL Schema Language Cheat Sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sogko/graphql-shorthand-notation-cheat-sheet/master/graphql-shorthand-notation-cheat-sheet.png){:target="\_blank"} is also helpful.

## GraphQL API reference

The documentation of the GraphQL API resources is automatically generated based on the GraphQL schema and varies depending on the used bundles.

## Breaking changes

The GraphQL API is [versionless](https://graphql.org/learn/best-practices/#versioning){:target="\_blank"} and changes to the API are primarily backward-compatible.

Should the GraphQL API change in a way that is not backward compatible, these changes are called "Breaking Changes" and may involve removing or renaming fields, arguments, or other parts of the schema. When a Breaking Change is created, there will be a transition period where the old from will continue to be supported and marked deprecated. Until a time when the parts marked as deprecated are removed.
