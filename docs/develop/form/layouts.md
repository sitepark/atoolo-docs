# Layouts

Layout elements in the UI Schema contain other UI Schema elements like controls or other layouts and serve the purpose of defining the layout of those, e.g. a layout could arrange all its contained UI Schema Elements into a horizontal alignment.

See also [UI Schema](https://jsonforms.io/docs/uischema/layouts){:target="\_blank"}.

The form editor currently only uses the following layout:

The input fields can be combined into individual groups in the form editor. These groups are arranged in a vertical layout.

```
- VerticalLayout
  - Group
    - Control
    - Control
    - ...
  - Group
    - Control
    - Control
    - ...
  ...
```

The form editor also provides a contact block. This is arranged below the group and contains additional layout levels for the arrangement of the contact data fields.

```
- VerticalLayout
  - Group
    - ...
    - Group (Start of the contact block)
      - HorizontalLayout (E.g. for the first name and surname field, which should be next to each other.)
        - Control (First name)
        - Control (Surname)
      - ...
  ...
```
