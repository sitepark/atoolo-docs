# Controls

Controls are the building blocks of forms. They are the elements that allow users to interact with the form. Controls can be simple, like a text input, or complex, like a date picker.

The controls that can be used in the forms are described below.

The indicator that should be used to define the tester for the renderer is also specified for each control type. The indicator is derived from various attributes of the JSON schema and the UI schema.

## Text field

A simple input field.

=== "JSON Schema"

    ```json
    {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Firstname"
    }
    ```

=== "UI Schema"

    ```json
    {
      "type": "Control",
      "scope": "#/properties/firstname",
      "label": "Firstname",
      "options": {
        "autocomplete": "name",
        "spaceAfter": true
      }
    }
    ```

    `autocomplete`
    : The `autocomplete` attribute specifies whether a form field should have autocomplete enabled. This is not to be confused with the `autocomplete` attribute for `enum` and `oneOf` for the [Autocomplete Renderer](https://jsonforms.io/examples/autocomplete).
    This attribute can be used to set the HTML `autocomplete` attribute as described [here](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofill). The React standard renderer does not evaluate this.

    `spaceAfter`
    : Ensures that a space is inserted after the input field. The React standard renderer does not evaluate this.

=== "Indicator"

    JSON-Schema: `type: "string"`

## Email field

A input field for email addresses.

=== "JSON Schema"

    ```json
    {
      "type": "string",

    : Ensures that a space is inserted after the input field. The React standard renderer does not evaluate this.

=== "Indicator"

    JSON-Schema: `type: "string"` and `format: "data-url"`

## Required Fields

Required fields are defined within the JSON schema. See [Required Properties](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object#required){:target="\_blank"}.

## Rules

[Rules](https://jsonforms.io/docs/uischema/rules){:target="\_blank"} allow for dynamic aspects for a form, e.g. by hiding or disabling UI schema elements.

No rules are currently supported by the form editor.
