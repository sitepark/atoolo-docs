It enables structured access to pages and content and depicts the information architecture logically and visually. In this way, it helps users to find their way around the application efficiently.</p> <p>In Atoolo, navigation has a special meaning: it not only maps the page structure, but can also influence the behavior of pages or teasers - depending on how they are arranged in the navigation.</p> <p>Each resource knows its direct superordinate and subordinate resources. The top elements of the navigation hierarchy - so-called root elements or homepages - are specially marked.</p> <p>A resource can be attached to several nodes in the navigation hierarchy. However, there must be no circularity. This means that a resource can have several higher-level resources - even from different hierarchies, i.e. below different homepages.</p> <p>The associated homepage of a resource is determined by following the link upwards. If there are several higher-level resources, one of them is marked as the primary link. This results in the primary path of the resource.</p> <p>Some properties of the website - such as theming information, header or footer - are stored on the homepage resource. This information is determined by identifying the associated homepage and reading its data. For example, the primary color of a page can be controlled centrally.</p> <p>This principle can be extended: Information can be stored not only directly on the homepage, but also on another resource within the navigation path. For example, a special header or footer can be configured on a rubric page. The current page then scrolls up the navigation path until the information is found. This allows data to be \"inherited\" recursively via the navigation - e.g. the kicker of a teaser.</p> <p>The following diagram shows how \"Page A.1\" is linked in the navigation.

In this scenario, it is not necessary for the IES to create the users in the system, as authentication takes place directly via the external identity provider.</p> </li> <li> <p>Role assignment in the IES: In this scenario, the roles and authorizations are assigned manually in the IES. The IES receives the authentication information from the external identity provider and assigns the corresponding roles based on the rules defined in the IES.

The strategy for deploying Atoolo projects in the IES context is described below.</p> <p>The strategy is designed so that files no longer need to be loaded from a Git or Composer repository for deployment. The deployment is carried out by providing the project with all dependencies in a <code>tar.gz</code> archive. This archive is unpacked on the target server into a directory specifically created for this archive. E.G.</p> <pre><code>/apps/myproject-1.0.0\n</code></pre> <p>This deployment bundle provides a 'deploy' command that is now executed in the project.</p> <pre><code>/apps/myproject-1.0.0/bin/console deployment:deploy\n</code></pre> <p>Execute the command for the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>a Platform Check is performed to ensure that the required PHP version and the required PHP extensions are installed.</li> <li>create the Symfony caches for e.g. containers, routing, etc.</li> <li>execute bundle- and project-specific deployment task</li> </ol> <p>The project may only be activated once all steps have been successfully completed. This is done by setting a symlink to the directory that the web server uses for the relevant host.</p> <pre><code>/apps/myproject -&gt; /apps/myproject-1.0.0/\n</code></pre> <p>This enables a smooth update to a new version. It is also possible to roll back to a previous version.</p> <p>By using a symlink, however, there are a few things to consider for the PHP project.</p> <ul> <li>In the standard configuration, opcache does not recognize when the real path to a PHP file changes. However, this is the case if the symlink points to a new version. The option   <pre><code>opcache.revalidate_path = 1\n</code></pre>   can change this behavior. This means that the opcache checks whether the real path has changed with every request. This can be done in the web server configuration. For Apache, for example, in the VirtualHost configuration.   <pre><code>SetEnv PHP_VALUE \"opcache.revalidate_path = 1\"\n</code></pre>   This means that the configuration is retained even after a PHP minor update if the system creates a new configuration directory for the PHP version.</li> <li>The configuration of the web server must also be adapted. The web server must be configured so that it follows the symlink. In Apache, for example, this can be achieved with the <code>FollowSymLinks</code> option.</li> <li>When using the Symfony message bus, there are workers that wait for the messages.

For example, qf=title^2.0 description means that the title field is twice as important as the description field. <code>phraseFields</code> This parameter increases the importance of whole phrases (word sequences) in the specified fields. It is used to increase the relevance of documents in which the search terms appear as phrases in these fields. For example, pf=title^1.5 content increases the relevance of documents in which the search terms appear as a phrase in the title field more than in the content field. <code>boostQueries</code> This parameter allows additional query clauses that increase the relevance score of documents that match these clauses. These clauses do not affect whether a document matches the main query, but increase the score of documents that match them. For example, <code>contenttype:(text/html*)^10</code> would increase the relevance score of HTML documentserh\u00f6hen. <code>boostFunctions</code> This parameter applies function-based boosts to the relevance score.

Other types of errors should remain in the error array.</p> <p>Generally, the error array is reserved for System Errors. These errors typically occur unexpectedly and cannot be handled gracefully by the client. They should be logged and monitored on the server side, while the client displays a generic error message to the user.</p> <p>Another use case for the error array is errors that can occur across all queries and should be processed centrally by the client. An example is an access-denied error.</p> <p>In contrast, Domain Errors in the business logic are useful for clients to recognize and communicate to users. These errors should become part of the defined response types in your schema.</p> <p>GraphQL's Union Types enable elegant and expressive error handling. Instead of relying on traditional exceptions, you explicitly define all possible response scenarios in the schema.</p> <p>Consider user registration: normally, a registration either succeeds or fails. With Union Types, you can model this precisely in the GraphQL schema. You define a return type that can be either a successfully registered user or a detailed registration error.</p> <p>The key advantage is predictability and clarity. The client knows exactly which scenarios can occur and must handle them explicitly. This leads to more robust code and better error handling. Instead of catching unexpected exceptions, the client can respond specifically to different error types\u2014such as when an email address already exists or when a password doesn't meet security requirements.</p> <p>GraphQL essentially forces developers to think through all error cases and document them in the schema.

These are mathematical functions that adjust the score based on field values or other criteria. For example, <code>if(termfreq(sp_objecttype,'news'),scale(sp_date,0,12),scale(sp_date,10,11)</code> could be used to score older news articles less highly <code>tie</code> (Tie-Breaker-Multiplikator) This parameter combine the best match points from multiple fields. The tie parameter adjusts how much lower scores affect the overall score. A higher tie value means that the lower scores have more influence on the final score. For example, tie=0.1 could be used to give the secondary fields some influence in the scoring process, preventing only the best matches from dominating. <p>Setting the boosting parameters requires in-depth knowledge of how the search index works and its schema. If no boosting is specified, the default values of Sitepark are used, which have already proven themselves in many projects.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>query {\n  search(input: {\n     ...\n     boosting: {\n      queryFields: [\n        \"sp_title^1.4\",\n        \"keywords^1.2\",\n        \"description^1.0\",\n        \"title^1.0\",\n        \"url^0.9\",\n        \"content^0.8\"\n      ]\n      phraseFields: [\n        \"sp_title^1.5\",\n        \"description^1\",\n        \"content^0.8\"\n      ]\n      boostQueries: [\n        \"sp_objecttype:searchTip^100\",\n        \"contenttype:(text/html*)^10\"\n      ]\n      boostFunctions: [\n        \"if(termfreq(sp_objecttype,'news'),scale(sp_date,0,12),scale(sp_date,10,11))\"\n      ]\n      tie: 0.1\n    }\n  }) {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Warning</p> <p>The boosting parameters are matched to the fields of the index.
